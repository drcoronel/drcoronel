## Hi there :) 

I am Daniel Coronel. I am a geophysicist and enthusiastic data scientist :heart_eyes:. I am passionate about working with multi-scale and multi-demensional data. Currenly, I am working using machine learning methods on seismic interpretation applications. I have used computer vision, as well as time series analysis to wellbore and seismic data. 

*My main interests are*:

- Quantitative seismic interpretation :boom:
- Geospatial data-science :eart_americas:
- Visualization :mag:
- Computer vision :eyes:

## Projects :rocket:

- [**F3**](https://github.com/drcoronel/F3) :construction_worker:: Experimental project to learn about parsing different subsurface data formats. Most of the parsers read *OpendTect* formats. Additionally, I created some small scripts to create seismic, horizons and well objects and the ability to interact with them. 

- [**FWI**](https://github.com/drcoronel/FWI-): Numerical methods course project from my Master's degree. We work on a seismic inversion problem to recover a velocity model from shot gathers. Here, we put in practice solving differential partial equations (Acoustic wave equation) and optimization algorithms to solve the inverse problem.
